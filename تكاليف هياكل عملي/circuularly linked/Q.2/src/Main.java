        Node<E> current = tail.getNext();
        while (current != tail) {

//In this implementation, we first check if the list is empty by testing if tail is null. If it is, then there are no nodes in the list and we return 0. Otherwise, we initialize a counter to 1 (since we know there is at least one node in the list) and set a reference to the first node (tail.getNext()). We then traverse the list using a loop that stops when we reach the starting node again (current != tail). Inside the loop, we increment the counter and move to the next node (current = current.getNext()). Finally, we return the total count.
//        Note that this implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list. Also note that maintaining an instance variable for size would be more efficient than computing it on demand like this.
